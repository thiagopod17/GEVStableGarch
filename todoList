#   Things to do on Package now
    - Colocar tres autores em todos locais, R help, R code headers.
    - citar pacote fGarch nas referencias dos codigos que eu aproveitei.
    - change name of class ( retirar prefixo f)
    - fill in the help of the package
    - test the script of the papper
    - update GEV table if necessary
    - send it to CRAN
    - update information on gev estimation in the package
    - find non-asc ii caracteres in gat-dist.
    
    

# More tests if you have time. hahaha
    - SIM function
    - FIT function
    

# Improvements 
    - GEV estimation fails when there are outliers, i.e. max-min is big.
    - sqp.restriction algorithm must be tested with others datasets.

# Before submiting to CRAN

    - Plan a wise test for function gsFit and gsSelect
    - Clear unnecessary comments
    - Atualizar copyrights
    - Test the onAttach function.



# Naming: 
      user functions: gsFit, gsSelect, gsMomentAparch
      variables: cond.dist, arma.order, garch.llh
      constans: TOLG, TOLSTABLE, ARMA.ORDER
      internal functions: .getStart, .getFormula


# Changes on function names:

gsGarchDist    .armaGarchDist
filter.Arma     .filterArma
filter.Aparch   .filterAparch
filter.Aparch.Forloop     .filterAparchForLoop
filter1.garch11Fit
gsGetOrder    .getOrder
gsGetStart     .getStart
changed variable name from 'gm' to 'gamma'











# Advices for Debugging: 

  - See the TOLG and TOLGSTABLE parameters in function gsGetStart. They were originally set to 
    1e-7 and 2e-2.



# Changes on papper:


- Sugestao para o abstract: The results suggest that this kind of distributions clearly outperforms the Gaussian case. However, when a-stable and Students t distributions are compared, a general conclusion should be avoided as the goodness-of-fit measures favor the a-stable distribution in the case of S&P 500 returns and the 












# Future modifications on package:

    - Implement the ARMA dist function for every distribution. 
    - Currently the code is working for ARMA(1,1) ARMA(p,1) ARMA(1,n) models with condtional normal. 
    - Find A More Efficiet Way To Calculate The GEV Aparch Moment Instead Of Using The Integration function.
