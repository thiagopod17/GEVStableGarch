#   Things to do on Package now
    - fill in the help of the package
    - test the script of the papper
    - update GEV table if necessary
    - send it to CRAN    
    - conferir se as distribuicoes normal e outras estao como principais no help.
    

# More tests if you have time
    - Prepare a unit test that can be run automatically, checking values with tables.
    Take a look at the test package from R before creating these test cases.
    - SIM function
    - FIT function
    

# Improvements 
    - sqp.restriction algorithm must be tested with others datasets.

# Before submiting to CRAN

    - Plan a wise test for function gsFit and gsSelect
    - Clear unnecessary comments
    - Atualizar copyrights
    - Test the onAttach function.



# Naming: 
      user functions: gsFit, gsSelect, gsMomentAparch
      variables: cond.dist, arma.order, garch.llh
      constans: TOLG, TOLSTABLE, ARMA.ORDER
      internal functions: .getStart, .getFormula


# Changes on function names:

gsGarchDist    .armaGarchDist
filter.Arma     .filterArma
filter.Aparch   .filterAparch
filter.Aparch.Forloop     .filterAparchForLoop
filter1.garch11Fit
gsGetOrder    .getOrder
gsGetStart     .getStart
changed variable name from 'gm' to 'gamma'











# Advices for Debugging: 

  - See the TOLG and TOLGSTABLE parameters in function gsGetStart. They were originally set to 
    1e-7 and 2e-2.





# Future modifications on package:

    - Implement the ARMA dist function for every distribution. 
    - Currently the code is working for ARMA(1,1) ARMA(p,1) ARMA(1,n) models with condtional normal. 
    - Find A More Efficiet Way To Calculate The GEV Aparch Moment Instead Of Using The Integration function.
    - Advices of professor Doctor Paolella.
    - Prediction methods using the results of Brockwell for stable prediction.
